#Guessing Game

This is a guessing game, in this game a random number between 1 and 100 will be generated, you will try to guess this number. 

If your guess is within 10 values of the number, then the program will print out "warm"

If your guess is not within 10 values of the number then the program will print out "Cold". 

If your subsequent guess is closer to the number than your previous guess then the program will print out 'Warmer', if its further away, then it will print 'Colder'

When you guess the number, the program will print out the number of tries it took for you to guess the number
